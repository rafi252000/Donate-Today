                        <p class="font--covid">Unfortunately, yes. COVID-19 can spread anywhere you may come into close contact with an infected person. However, the risk of infection is much lower outdoors compared to indoor spaces.Remember, the virus spreads mainly via respiratory droplets that are released from an infected person through coughing, sneezing, talking or singing – which then get into the mouth, nose or eyes of people who are nearby. Short-range airborne (or aerosol) transmission is possible, particularly in poorly ventilated, crowded indoor places. People may also become infected by touching their mouth, nose or eyes, after touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, although emerging evidence suggests that this does not play a significant role in COVID-19 transmission.</p>
